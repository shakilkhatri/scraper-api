    "21": ",ICICI Securities ,–,Retail Equity Research,MOMENTUM PICK,Candlestick patterns describe the market sentiment for the specified period. Some of the formations suggest reversal of senti,men,t (trend) and, ,therefore, are important for a chart reader. By themselves, the patterns do not carry any price target but only an indication,of,change in market ,behaviour. More importance needs to be given to the placement of the pattern within larger trend,Morning Star,: Potential bottom reversal pattern made of three candle lines. The first sizeable black candle reflects a market in which th,e b,ears are in ,complete charge. The next candle line,--,the small real body,--,shows a slight diminution of the bearish force. The white candle tha,t makes up the last ,part of the morning star visually displays the bulls are gaining the upper hand. Lowest low amongst three candles becomes tec,hni,cal support,Bullish Engulfing Line,: A potential bottom reversal pattern. This pattern typically appears at the culmination of a decline or downtrend. The marke,t f,alls, ,and a black candle forms (ideally a small black candle). Next, a white real body wraps around the prior session’s black body.,Lo,w of the pattern ,becomes short term support for prices,Piercing Line,: Potential bottom reversal pattern. A black body forms in the downtrend. The market continues moving south on the next sessi,on’,s open ,but that session culminates in a white real body that closes (e.g. pierces) than half way or more into the prior black body. ,Low,est low between two ,candles is referred to as technical support for prices,Hammer,: A candlestick line which, during a downtrend, has a very long lower shadow and small real body (black or white) at the top ,end,of the ,session’s range. There should be no, or a very small, upper shadow. Pattern suggests buying support during declines and needs,co,nfirmation in terms ,of sustainability of prices above head of the Hammer in following session,Evening Star,: Potential Top reversal pattern made of three candle lines. Comparable with a traffic signal. First white candle reflects a ,mar,ket in bullish ,trend. The next candle line,--,the small real body,—,warns waning momentum. The black candle that completes the evening star visuall,y exhibits that ,prior up trend has stopped or reversed,Bearish Engulfing Line,: Potential top reversal signal. This two candlestick pattern emerges during a rally. A black candle real body wraps around a,white real body (classically a small white candle) Highest high between two candles becomes resistance level for prices for f,utu,re reference,Dark Cloud cover,: A dark cloud cover forms a top reversal pattern. The first session should be a strong, white real body. The second session’,s p,rice ,opens over the prior session’s high (or above the prior session’s close). By the end of the second session, it closes near th,e l,ow of the session and should ,fall well into the prior session’s white body. Pattern suggests that market has a poor chance of rising immediately,Shooting Star,: A single candlestick line during a rally in which there is a small real body (white or black) at the bottom end of the sess,ion,'s range and a ,very long upper shadow. The candle line should also have little or no lower shadow. Pattern suggest the trouble for prices ov,erh,ead,Continuation Patterns,: Other than widely known Candlestick reversal patterns discussed above, there are numerous patterns mentioned in literature ,on ,Candlestick which describe the continuation of existing sentiments i.e. bullish or bearish. We have refrained from mentioning,na,mes of these patterns ,to avoid confusion. However, the remark Continuation Pattern refers to bullish or bearish candlestick patterns which suggest ,con,tinuation of existing ,trend,Candlesticks Glossary ,February 23, 2024,ICICI Securities Ltd. | Retail Equity Research,21",
